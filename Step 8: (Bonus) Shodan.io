I also developed a small internet-wide scanning SOP utilizing Shodan.io. 
By gathering all assets that we have exposed to the internet, we can utilize Shodan’s monitoring functionality to gain the visibility that the world would be seeing.
https://monitor.shodan.io

This would allow an increase in vulnerability exposure awareness for the team. 
Looking at it from a hacker POV, hackers use that for passive recon – so why aren't we? Seeing what hackers utilize is crucial.
The Shodan database also gets updated quicker than any scanner when discusses critical vulnerabilities that need attention as soon as possible.
