I also introduced additional equations to prioritize our vulnerabilities:
- Asset Criticality
- Threat/Vulnerability Intelligence (as described in previous step)
- Security Controls
- Threat modeling (e.g. who our threat actors are, what kind of POCs are being released, how can we model what we think our actors are capable of)
