I formed automation here and created a tool that grabs all CVEs from our Vulnerability Scanners and feeds them into the SOC team in 
which can produce mitigation controls prior to the remediation process. 
Doing this will allow our team to ensure we have mitigation plans in place regardless of whether the vulnerability has been filed internally or not yet.

uite a small python tool:

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

CVE_Collection = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in open('cve')]
length = len(CVE_Collection)
f = open('sidList.txt','w')
f.close()
for i in range (0, length):
	cve = CVE_Collection[i]
	url = "https://www.snort.org/rule_docs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&rules_query=" + cve + "&search_type=standard&submit_rule_search="
	x = requests.get(url)	
	
   	if 'Search returned' in x.text:
		soup = BeautifulSoup(x.text,'lxml')
		for tag in soup.find_all('span',{"class":"categories"}):
			with open('sidList.txt','a') as afile:
				afile.write(tag.text +'\n')
				print ("SID: " + tag.text + " found.")
