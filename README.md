# Vulnerability-Management-Program-Build

1 year as a Vulnerability Management Engineer has taught me quite a lot. 
I focused on being the architect behind the advancements of a modern risk-centric program. 

This repo is to share my thought process behind the work I initiated.

Overall lesson?
That a Vulnerability Management program will only be functional if thereâ€™s a collaboration being done from all sides of the company. It helps control the risk that an organization has to go through just for being present, and that tackling a program is not as simple as remediating every vulnerability, but instead to approach it in a way of understanding how to tackle the risk.
