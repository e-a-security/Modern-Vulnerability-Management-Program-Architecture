# Modern-Vulnerability-Management-Program-Architecture

1 year as a Vulnerability Management Engineer has taught me a lot. I spent a lot of this time researching industry-leading programs and began to architect the advancement of a risk-centric Vulnerability Management program.

From a ticket system to a vulnerability risk mitigation program focused on business impact.

Overall lesson?
That a Vulnerability Management program will only be functional if thereâ€™s a collaboration being done from all sides of the company. It helps control the risk that an organization has to go through just for being present, and that tackling a program is not as simple as remediating every vulnerability, but instead to approach it in a way of understanding how to tackle the risk.
