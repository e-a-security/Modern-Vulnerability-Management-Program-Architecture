I also took it a step further to create a small penetration testing program inside the vulnerability management team. 
I believed that as we continued to become more proactive, we should look into introducing ourselves to network and infrastructure pentesting.

A great source I found for doing this was: https://www.crest-approved.org/wp-content/uploads/CREST-Penetration-Testing-Guide-1.pdf

Internal Penetration Testing:
Part 1: Understanding our purpose, scope, rationale, audience. 
Part 2: Understanding the goal, challenges, and outline of our program
Part 3: Development of requirements, technical security assurance framework, governance structure, targets
Part 4: Development of testing structure, scope statements, testing constraints, management control processes, testing methodology, sufficient research and planning, identification of vulnerabilities 
Part 5: Tabletop, research and plan your control flow prior to exploitation.
Part 6: Exploit vulnerabilities
Part 7: Remediate weaknesses, address root causes of weaknesses, initiate improvement of the program, evaluate assessment effectiveness, build on lessons learned, create and monitor action plans
Part 8: Maturity Model, maturity assessment
 
Tabletop exercise:
Part 1: Objectives: Plans, policies, procedures, cooperation, factorial and time and accuracy, training needs
Part 2: Select a scenario: Realistic, identify a likely crisis, risk-specific, identify which departments will be targeted/affected
Part 3: Select leader/participants
Part 4: Create a conducive environment, a clear line of vision
Part 5: An agenda, relevant policies, and plans, a written copy of the scenario, maintaining good time management, set ground rules, encourage a certain type of thinking
Part 6: Post-exercise evaluation: What worked well, what didn't work well, what areas need improvement
Part 7: Summary of objectives and exercise, ticketing vulnerabilities that were taken advantage of, analyzing root cause. 
Part 8: Meet to discuss follow-up actions
