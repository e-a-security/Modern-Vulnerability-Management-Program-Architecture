I then took a look at our KPIs, which revolved around the general awareness of tickets. 

I felt like we are not painting the complete picture. 
I believe that proper Vulnerability Management KPIs should highlight the awareness of our risk surface and risk level as an organization. 

Severity: Vulnerabilities that have the most risk.
Vendor/Platform/Product: Average number of vulns per specific platform, vendor, or product.
Vulnerable Targets: Provide an overview of the attack surface, showing number of vulnerable assets.
Remediation Percentage: Portion of vulns fixed each month.
Remediation: Average number of days before a vuln is remediated.
Vuln Category: Establish which type of attacks might be a risk to the systems (CWE)
Total Vuln Growth: Total number of vulns.
