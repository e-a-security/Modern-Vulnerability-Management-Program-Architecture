This project introduced a defense-in-depth strategy against zero-day exploits by allowing the vulnerability management team to be proactive with the
hreat landscape of the organization.Â Just like any other company, we are vulnerable to zero-day attacks. 
However, adding a zero-day offense to our existing vulnerability management process helps shield our assets from new and emerging vulnerabilities.

General Flow:
Ongoing stream of data related to current threats that potentially affect organization gets fed into a Threat Intel tool, maintained by Threat Intel.
IT maintains a vendor List.

IT provides Vuln Mgmt team vendor list, Threat Intel team provides data stream, Vuln mgmt collectively works on exploit development/vuln research to proactively
discover security flaws.
