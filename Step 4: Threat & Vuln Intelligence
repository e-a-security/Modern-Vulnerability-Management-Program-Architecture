There are a few different factors here, Threat modeling, global threat intelligence, vulnerability intelligence, and a development of a zero-day offense program.

Below is a set of resources that I’ve utilized before on a personal level to remain up to date with the threat landscape 
and to keep an eye out on vulnerabilities that potentially affect myself or the organization I work for.

  The news streams from The Hacker News, Dark Reading and The Register are all worth following.  
The Online Security Blog from Google, CloudFlare and Arbor have posts on industry observations. 
The blogs of F-Secure, AVG, Securelist, Trend Micro and Malwarebytes cover security news that is mostly related to malware and exploits. They also offer good input for threat intelligence.

I utilized 3 different toolings here, and collaborated with the Threat Intelligence team.
I utilized a vulnerability scanner to collect the vulnerabilities that we are vulnerable to, then I utilized Recorded Future, 
then I utilized a SIEM such as Splunk to prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk.
