My first step was to get the team together and understand a vision and purpose. 

The mission statement of the program was originally to drive the vulnerability management process, ensuring SLAs are met and related risks are properly addressed.

To me, this felt like we were undervaluing the team, and our responsibilities. Although that statement is not wrong, we were indeed driving the VM process, we were doing much more. We were developing objectives to reduce the overall risk of the organization. We were identifying new areas of exposure, we were forecasting risks, and developing vulnerability intelligence, the list goes on
